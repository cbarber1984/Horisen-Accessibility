This is a project where I had to update a hypothetical client website 
to include image tags and semantic HTML elements rather than generic
divs. 

#### Key Learnings:
    - Updating HTML elements requires updates to CSS elments as well
    - The "Scout Principle" of leaving code cleaner than you found it
    - Background images incorporated through CSS rather than as <img> elements
      cannot receive alt tags and should only be decorative.
